# Pong Using Turtle

Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball.
The goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

## Technologies Used

- 	Turtle library of Python.
-	Basic OOPS.
-	Functions in python.
-	Simple math and its application.



## Roadmap

1) We imported turtle library of python.
2) We initialised the size and colour attributes of our game window.
3) We intialised the rate of updation of the window or the delay in the animation (tracer).
3) We specified the dimensions of the two paddles: Paddle A and B and the ball. 
 
 
 
We also specified their default locations in the window in the pixel format.
4) We made the pen attribute to jot down the scores of the players and to display them on the screen.
 
5) We used functions to define several operations moving the paddles up and down, also setting the keys  which will be used to move the paddles.

6) We defined some border conditions for the ball when it hits the border it needs to deflect and move in the opposite direction and also for the collision of the ball and paddles.
 
 
7) We took care of some glitches in ball movement and specified some other boundary conditions.
8) Finally we added some sound and made some more final changes to complete the project.
